    "\n",
    "REST: REST follows a stateless client-server communication model. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to interact \n",

    "SOAP: SOAP relies on a messaging protocol for communication. It can use various transport protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, or TCP.\n",
    "Data Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: RESTful APIs often use lightweight data formats like JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (eXtensible Markup Language) for data\n",
    "representation. JSON is more commonly used due to its simplicity and ease of parsing.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP uses XML for data representation. SOAP messages are typically more verbose and contain additional metadata compared to REST.\n",
    "Protocol:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: REST is protocol-independent but commonly uses HTTP as the underlying protocol for communication. It leverages HTTP methods and \n",
    "status codes to handle resource operations and status information.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP can use various protocols for transport, such as HTTP, SMTP, or TCP. It provides its own protocol for messaging and is not tightly \n",
    "coupled with HTTP.\n",
    "Flexibility and Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: REST is known for its flexibility and scalability. It allows for the creation of loosely coupled services that can be easily extended and\n",
    "modified. RESTful APIs can evolve over time without affecting clients that rely on them.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP is often associated with a more rigid and tightly coupled architecture. It relies on formal contracts (WSDL) and strong typing,\n",
    "which can make it less flexible and harder to modify or extend without impacting existing clients.\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: RESTful APIs are typically lightweight and have better performance due to their use of simpler data formats like JSON and the stateless \n",
    "nature of HTTP.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP messages tend to be larger in size due to XML's verbose nature, which can result in increased network bandwidth usage and slower \n",
    "performance.\n",
    "Ease of Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "REST: RESTful APIs are relatively easy to understand, use, and consume. They have a more intuitive and human-readable structure,\n",
    "making them easier to work with, especially for developers.\n",
    "SOAP: SOAP can be more complex to implement and consume. It requires additional configuration, and the XML-based structure of SOAP \n",
    "messages can be harder to read and work with.\n",
